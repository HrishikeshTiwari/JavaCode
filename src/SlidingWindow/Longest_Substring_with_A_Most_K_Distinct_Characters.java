package SlidingWindow;
/*
 * Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
✅ Example:
Input:
s = "eceba", k = 2
Output:
3
Explanation:
The substring "ece" has only 2 distinct characters and is the longest possible.
✅ Approach Hint:
Use a sliding window and a HashMap to track characters and their frequencies.

Expand the window until there are more than k distinct characters.

Then shrink the window from the left until you're back to k or fewer distinct characters.
