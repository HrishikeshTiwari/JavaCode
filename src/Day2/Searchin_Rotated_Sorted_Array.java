 * Problem statement
 * Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
You are given a sorted array that has been rotated at some unknown pivot. You need to find a target element in this array in O(log n) time.

üîç Example 1:
java
Copy
Edit
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0  
Output: 4  
(0 is found at index 4)
		 */
		
		
		/*Approach (Using Modified Binary Search)
		 The array is sorted but rotated, so we can‚Äôt apply normal binary search directly.
		 We modify binary search:
		 One half of the array will always be sorted.
		 We check which half is sorted and decide where to search next.
		 If the left half is sorted, check if the target is in this range.
		 If the right half is sorted, check if the target is in this range.

		int target=0;
		System.out.println("The element is present at Location\n"+search(arr,target));

				if(target>=arr[low] && target<arr[mid]) {
					high=mid-1;
